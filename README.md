# Hello-World-project
First repository as part of the training exercise
Hello, I'm Wire and this is my first attempt at GitHub. I've been coding for a few months with Python and am excited that I finally got my first project working!
I'm a big fan of baking and have created a sourdough that satisfies my craving for super sour bread!
